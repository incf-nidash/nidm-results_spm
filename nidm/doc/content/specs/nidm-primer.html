            This document provides an intuitive introduction and guide to the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) for software
            interoperability. NIDM defines a core vocabulary that extends the PROV Data Model for provenance with terms
            that capture information about neuroimaging research, from data acquisition to analysis and results. This primer
            explains the fundamental NIDM concepts and provides examples of its use. The primer is intended as a

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This primer document provides an accessible introduction to the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) for data
            sharing at Web scale. NIDM is an extensible framework for community driven development of metadata standards
            that captures a broad spectrum of research information, particularly data provenance. The provenance of a
            given piece of neuroimaging data represents its origin, which can facilitate reproducible research by capturing
            a description of how data was processed. The NIDM Family of Documents includes specifications that define
            recommendations for how to model neuroimaging research information across several stages of the research
            process, referred to as NIDM Components.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a specification for neuroimaging data exchange, NIDM Components address specific information needs for the
            neuroimaging community. Different NIDM users or developers may have different perspectives on the types of
            neuroimaging data they would like to exchange.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One perspective may focus on representing high-level information about a neuroimaging database. For example,
                an XNAT database provider may want to provide an standard description of the projects it contains that is
                interoperable with a similar description of a COINS or HID database. This dataset descriptor would allow a
                service to aggregate dataset descriptions that could then be interrogated at a finer level of detail.
            </li>
            <li>
                A second focus may be to query for low-level details about participant demographics and DICOM metadata (e.g.,
                TR or slice thickness) stored in an XNAT database. For example, a user may identify a dataset of interest in
                the previous example and want to retrieve the download links for structural scans from normal controls over
                18 years of age.
            </li>
            <li>
                A third perspective might be interested in the results of a statistical analysis. For example, an author
                may have published their dataset with OpenfMRI and included their results from a task-based fMRI experiment.
                A researcher may be interested in including this dataset in a meta-analysis, and can query its NIDM
                representation to retrieve all the necessary pieces of information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This primer document aims to ease the adoption of the NIDM specifications by providing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A high-level explanation of how NIDM models different types of neuroimaging information.</li>
            <li>
                A simple example explaining how information from a neuroimaging database can be modeled as an extension of
                PROV and include a number of useful vocabularies as annotations on the model.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intuitive overview of NIDM</h2>
        <p>
            This section provides an explanation of the main concepts in NIDM, which are extensions of PROV. As this
            document is meant as a starting point, refer to PROV and the NIDM specification for a given Component for
            detailed recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            A central theme in NIDM is to view all the information produced during the course of an investigation in the
            context of provenance, which is accomplished by building NIDM as an extension of the W3C PROV recommendations
            (Figure 1). PROV defines a core set of high-level structures for capturing provenance information that
            bolsters trust in how a given piece of information was generated. The PROV specification details three core
            objects that are used to describe provenance, which are <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#term-entity">
            Entities</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#term-agent">Agents</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#term-Activity">Activities</a>. These core objects are related to each
            other with a set of defined relations, as highlighted in the figure below.
        </p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Entities are used to capture information that tends to persist over time, for example a dataset or spreadsheet
            file, which can be modified of derived from other entities. For an Entity, like a file, to be created, an
            Activity is needed that describes how the Entity came into existence, and an Agent is needed to describe who
            (e.g., a person) or what (e.g., an organization or software) is responsible for generating an Entity. The
            binding of these three objects provides the structure needed to trust how and who some file, dataset, or
            analysis was created.
        </p>
        <p>
            A central theme in NIDM is to view all the information produced during the course of an investigation in the
            context of provenance, which is accomplished by building NIDM as an extension of the W3C PROV recommendations.
            In addition to PROV, NIDM adopts a number of metadata vocabularies that are actively being used in the broader
            Web community (e.g., Dublin Core, FOAF, VoID, and DCAT). By adopting existing vocabularies and harmonizing
            our efforts with similar groups developing biomedical metadata standards (e.g., W3C Health Care and Life
            Sciences Interest Group, ISA Commons), NIDM is able to maintain a common description of high-level concepts
            that are shared across biomedical domains (e.g., project descriptions and participant demographics) while
            providing additional specificity for the neuroimaging domain. This additional specificity is captured in
            layers by building a NIDM Core vocabulary, based on PROV, that is then extended to model specific types of
            information, referred to as NIDM Components, and then linked together using a high-level dataset descriptor
            (Figure 2).

        <h4>Dataset Descriptor Component</h4>
            <p>
                The NIDM Dataset Descriptor Component is modeled after the efforts of the Health Care and Life Sciences
                (HCLS) Interest Group at the W3C. HCLS aims to provide a generic dataset descriptor recommendation that
                captures a general set of metadata that is applicable across domains. NIDM adopts the HCLS approach and
                extends it by providing an additional set of recommendations that are specific to neuroimaging. The HCLS
                Dataset Descriptors are organized into three levels â Summary, Version, and Distribution (Figure 3). The
                Summary-level is focused on information that does not change over the course of a project, while the
                Version-level captures changes that are specific to a given data release. The Distribution-level is
                intended to inform the consumer with links to where specific datasets can be accessed, which may come in
                one or more forms (e.g., relational database, tarball, or RDF). In the case of RDF, datasets can be
                described using the VoiD vocabulary (www.w3.org/TR/void/), which is the recommended approach with NIDM,
                as it allows each NIDM Component for a given project to be described independently and linked appropriately
                using URIs.

                    difference versions or releases of a dataset. Version-level descriptions provide information that is
                    specific to a given version. Distribution-level descriptors captures information that is specific to
                    a given format or serialization of a dataset. Figure adapted from the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joejimbo/HCLSDatasetDescriptions/blob/master/Overview.html#datasetdescriptionlevels">
